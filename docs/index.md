#### Inbound

The same account acts as a real inbound email address. You can send emails to that address from anywhere and these messages also end up on the account.

#### IMAP

The coolest feature out of all Ethereal features is that vanity email accounts act as real IMAP / POP3 accounts. You can access sent and received messages using your favorite email client, whatever that happens to be.

#### How to register?

You can create new accounts straight from Nodemailer. Use the username and password of the generated account to log in here as well.

#### How long are the messages stored?

All messages expire after 7 days.
